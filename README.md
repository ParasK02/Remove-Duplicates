# Remove-Duplicates
Simple script I built because my PC is slow and I keep download the same lecture slides over and over and store duplicates. Using Python this script searches all the files it the specified directory and will move any duplicates to the trash if their MD5 hash is the same. 

# Installation 
Need the dependancy send2trash, to send files to trash instead of releasing them into the infinite void. \
```pip install send2trash```

# Usage
Run the script using:\
```python main.py```\
A GUI will pop up and you can begin cleaning out your drives.
